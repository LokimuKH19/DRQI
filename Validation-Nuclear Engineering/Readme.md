## üîç Methodological Insight: Extension to Generalized Eigenvalue Problems
The log file in this filefolder is generated by DRQI_Reactor.py

In fact, many practical eigenvalue problems in nuclear engineering‚Äîsuch as neutron diffusion or transport models‚Äîtake the generalized form (differs from the normalized form we analyzed in the paper):

$$
L u = \lambda Q u,
$$

where $Q$ is a positive definite operator, often representing material properties or integral source terms.

In many engineering settings, especially in reactor simulations, the operator $Q$ is constant or spatially homogeneous. This allows a natural transformation of the problem into a standard form:

$$
Q^{-1} L u = \lambda u,
$$

or equivalently, by absorbing the constant into the eigenvalue:

$$
L u = \lambda' u.
$$

As a result, the current DRQI framework‚Äîoriginally developed for standard eigenvalue problems‚Äîremains directly applicable to a wide range of physically meaningful scenarios where $Q$ is constant. The flexibility of the loss function formulation also allows for future extension to non-trivial $Q$ operators:

$$
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_x \left[ L u_k(x; \theta) - (\lambda + 1) \left( \omega Q u_k(x; \theta) + (1 - \omega) Q u_{k-1}(x) \right) \right]^2.
$$

This opens the door to applying DRQI to more general operator pairs while maintaining a consistent training strategy.
