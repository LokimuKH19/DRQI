## üîç Methodological Insight: Extension to Generalized Eigenvalue Problems
The log file in this filefolder is generated by DRQI_Reactor.py

In fact, many practical eigenvalue problems in nuclear engineering‚Äîsuch as neutron diffusion or transport models‚Äîtake the generalized form (differs from the normalized form we analyzed in the paper):

$$
L u = \lambda Q u,
$$

where $Q$ is a positive definite operator, often representing material properties or integral source terms.

In many engineering settings, especially in reactor simulations, the operator $Q$ is constant or spatially homogeneous (e.g. those we discussed in Section 3.3). This allows a natural transformation of the problem into a standard form:

$$
Q^{-1} L u = \lambda u,
$$

or equivalently, by absorbing the constant into the eigenvalue:

$$
L' u = \lambda' u.
$$

As a result, the current DRQI framework‚Äîoriginally developed for standard eigenvalue problems‚Äîremains directly applicable to a wide range of physically meaningful scenarios where $Q$ is constant. The flexibility of the loss function formulation also allows for future extension to non-trivial $Q$ operators:

$$
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_x \bigg( L u_k(x; \theta) - (\lambda + 1)\[ \omega Q u_k(x;\theta) + (1-\omega) Q u_k1(x) \] \bigg)
$$

According to the result obtained in Section 3.1.1.2, the loss function would likely to convergence on the mean squared residual (MSR) of the PDE itself during training, forcing the trail function and the corresonding Rayleigh Quotient to fit the equation. This opens the door to applying DRQI to more general operator pairs while maintaining a consistent training strategy.

Although this new DRQI has not yet been tested, future reactor analysis software development is expected to incorporate the loss function of this new form.
