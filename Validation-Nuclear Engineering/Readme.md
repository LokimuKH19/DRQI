## üîç Methodological Insight: Extension to Generalized Eigenvalue Problems
The log files in this filefolder and DRQI/logs/3.3 were generated by `DRQI_Reactor.py` in the parentdirectory.

In fact, many practical eigenvalue problems in nuclear engineering‚Äîsuch as neutron diffusion or transport models‚Äîtake the generalized form (differs from the normalized form we analyzed in the paper):

$$
L u = \lambda Q u,
$$

where $Q$ is a positive definite operator, often representing material properties or integral source terms.

In many engineering settings, especially in reactor simulations, the operator $Q$ is constant or spatially homogeneous (e.g. those we discussed in Section 3.3). This allows a natural transformation of the problem into a standard form:

$$
Q^{-1} L u = \lambda u,
$$

or equivalently, by absorbing the constant into the eigenvalue:

$$
L' u = \lambda' u.
$$

As a result, the current DRQI framework‚Äîoriginally developed for standard eigenvalue problems‚Äîremains directly applicable to a wide range of physically meaningful scenarios where $Q$ is constant. The flexibility of the loss function formulation also allows for future extension to non-trivial $Q$ operators, where $u^{k-1}$ means the trail function at the ${k-1}$ th step. (Why can't GitHub render bottom brackets properly... („Éª‚àÄ„Éª(„Éª‚àÄ„Éª(„Éª‚àÄ„Éª*) ):

$$
l(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_x \bigg( L u_k(x; \theta) - (\lambda + 1)\[ \omega Q u_k(x;\theta) + (1-\omega) Q u^{k-1}(x) \] \bigg)
$$

In addition, the update of the Rayleigh Quotiet should use the generalized form:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\langle Lu, u \rangle}{\langle Qu, u \rangle}
$$

According to the result obtained in Section 3.1.1.2, the loss function would likely to convergence on the mean squared residual (MSR) of the PDE itself during training, forcing the trail function and the corresonding Rayleigh Quotient to fit the equation. This opens the door to applying DRQI to more general operator pairs while maintaining a consistent training strategy.

Only 1d results is reported in the paper, still you can use it to do with higher dimensional problems, see the **2d** and **3d** log files in this folder. However, the engineering meaning of these cases is not strong enough to display in this paper. 

Although this new DRQI is tested when Q is a constant, future `2d fuel components analysis software` development is expected to incorporate the loss function of this new form.
